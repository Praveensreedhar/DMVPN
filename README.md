****Understanding Cisco DMVPN (Dynamic Multi-point VPN)

Dynamic multi-point VPN is a cost-effective solution for interconnecting lots of branch offices together with ease of configuration and security. 
It reduces the configuration complexity and increases flexibility and scalability.

With DMVPN a central hub router in the head office manages all the spoke location router with the dynamic IP address and can access company 
resources anywhere from the locations.

DMVPN utilizes mGRE tunnels, NHRP, and IPSec encryption to interconnect spoke and hub routers together without compromising security and 
flexibility.
